-- Module:       Data.OpenUnion.Internal
-- Description:  Open unions (type-indexed co-products) for extensible effects.

-- Maintainer:   Alexis King <lexi.lambda@gmail.com>
-- Stability:    experimental
-- Portability:  GHC specific language extensions.
--
-- These are internal definitions and should be used with caution. There are no
-- guarantees that the API of this module will be preserved between minor
-- versions of this package.
--
-- Open unions (type-indexed co-products, i.e. type-indexed sums) for
-- extensible effects All operations are constant-time.
--
-- Based on
-- <http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/OpenUnion51.hs OpenUnion51.hs>.
--
-- Type-list @r :: [* -> *]@ of open union components is a small Universe.
-- Therefore, we can use a @Typeable@-like evidence in that universe. In our
-- case a simple index of an element in the type-list is sufficient
-- substitution for @Typeable@.
