-- | Effectful arrow type: a function from @a :: *@ to @b :: *@ that also does
-- effects denoted by @effs :: [* -> *]@.
type Arr effs a b = a -> Eff effs b

-- | An effectful function from @a :: *@ to @b :: *@ that is a composition of
-- several effectful functions. The paremeter @effs :: [* -> *]@ describes the
-- overall effect. The composition members are accumulated in a type-aligned
-- queue.
type Arrs effs a b = FTCQueue (Eff effs) a b

-- | The 'Eff' monad provides the implementation of a computation that performs
-- an arbitrary set of algebraic effects. In @'Eff' effs a@, @effs@ is a
-- type-level list that contains all the effects that the computation may
-- perform. For example, a computation that produces an 'Integer' by consuming a
-- 'String' from the global environment and acting upon a single mutable cell
-- containing a 'Bool' would have the following type:
--
-- @
-- 'Eff' '['Control.Monad.Freer.Reader.Reader' 'String', 'Control.Monad.Freer.State.State' 'Bool'] 'Integer'
-- @
--
-- Normally, a concrete list of effects is not used to parameterize 'Eff'.
-- Instead, the 'Member' or 'Members' constraints are used to express
-- constraints on the list of effects without coupling a computation to a
-- concrete list of effects. For example, the above example would more commonly
-- be expressed with the following type:
--
-- @
-- 'Members' '['Control.Monad.Freer.Reader.Reader' 'String', 'Control.Monad.Freer.State.State' 'Bool'] effs => 'Eff' effs 'Integer'
-- @
--
-- This abstraction allows the computation to be used in functions that may
-- perform other effects, and it also allows the effects to be handled in any
-- order.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- | Runs a pure 'Eff' computation, since an 'Eff' computation that performs no
-- effects (i.e. has no effects in its type-level list) is guaranteed to be
-- pure. This is usually used as the final step of running an effectful
-- computation, after all other effects have been discharged using effect
-- handlers.
--
-- Typically, this function is composed as follows:
--
-- @
-- someProgram
--   'Data.Function.&' runEff1 eff1Arg
--   'Data.Function.&' runEff2 eff2Arg1 eff2Arg2
--   'Data.Function.&' 'run'

-- | Like 'run', 'runM' runs an 'Eff' computation and extracts the result.
-- /Unlike/ 'run', 'runM' allows a single effect to remain within the type-level
-- list, which must be a monad. The value returned is a computation in that
-- monad, which is useful in conjunction with 'sendM' or 'liftBase' for plugging
-- in traditional transformer stacks.
